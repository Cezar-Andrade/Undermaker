This constructor/class allows for all types of dialogs to be displayed on screen.
This can be used separatedly to make dialogs anytime you want, anywhere you want for any use you want.
Some functionality it lacks that you need can be done by using the [func] command, so you call the functions yourself for whatever purpose you need, it's limited however due to how this system works.
For the masking of the container's tail sprite the shader shd_alpha_masking, it is a pretty simple shader that inverts the alpha like this: (1 - source_alpha), if you remove it, you may cause an error when using the masking sprite, avoid deleting it unless you know what you're doing.

REAL _x -------------------------------------> Initial X position of the dialog, being the origin the left top corner.
REAL _y -------------------------------------> Initial Y position of the dialog, being the origin the left top corner.
ARRAY OF STRINGS / STRING _dialogues --------> Dialogues that will be displayed on screen, using the proper format for dialogues.
INTEGER _width ------------------------------> Amount of text that can fit horizontally in pixels, you can use a REAL number but it functions as a truncated INTEGER instead 'cause pixels counting cannot be REAL, so just use integers please.
REAL _height --------------------------------> Minimum height of the dialog, if text doesn't fit in that height, it will be higher then to contain the text, but if the text leaves space, it will extend to that size.
REAL _xscale --------------------------------> Initial X scale of the dialog as a whole.
REAL _yscale --------------------------------> Initial Y scale of the dialog as a whole.
ARRAY OF INTEGERS / INTEGER _voices ---------> ID or IDs of the audios that will be used for the voice of every single letter being displayed, by default it uses the monster voice.
INTEGER _face_sprite ------------------------> ID of the sprite to be used as a portrait in the dialog, if undefined is given, no portrait sprite will be shown, by default is undefined.
ARRAY OF INTEGERS / INTEGER _face_subimages -> ID or IDs of the subimages of the sprite that will be used to animate it, if undefined is given, it will take all the subimages from the sprite and iterate through all of them by default for the animation, by default is undefined.
INTEGER _container_sprite -------------------> ID of the sprite to be used as a container to hold the entire dialog inside it, used to make dialog bubbles basically, its collision region determinates where the text of the dialog can be contained and it will scale to fit all of the text inside it, it is recommended to use a sprite with nine-slices activated.
INTEGER _container_tail_sprite --------------> ID of the sprite to be used as the tail of the container, used to make the dialog bubbles with tail, so you don't have to make multiple sprites with different position of the tail, the heavy calculation for its positioning was already made by me and a friend, really heavy math XD.
INTEGER _container_tail_mask_sprite ---------> ID of the sprite to be used as a mask region to determinate where the tail should be drawn, can be any size but have in mind that it will scale to fit the size of the container itself.

	This functions calls the add_dialogues(), the difference is that this one deletes all the current dialogues that are loaded and sets the new ones you load in it, making a good reset with new dialogues.
	This functions is not used by the main code or any commands, so you can modify it as you want, be sure to know what you're doing when modifying the dialog system information, it is meant for you the programmer to be used in code in case you need it.
	
	The original code in this makes it so all information of the old dialogues is cleared and handles the new dialogues with the settings the dialog was in the moment this function was called, except the asterisk, that one gets reset again to true.
	This means that if you set a [font] through a dialogue and this function is being called before that font is being set in the dialogue, it will keep the previous font instead of the new one, and that info is used to shape the new dialogues.
	So be careful of when you call this function if you depend on the previous configuration of the dialogues, one way to avoid this is to set your new dialogues with that in mind and reset the settings to not depend on that.
	The only exception to this is the portrait sprite in the dialog, as that one will be reset/removed when calling this function, you can set the starting one by passing the arguments of it of course.
	In short, nothing is being reset or removed with this function, except the portrait sprite, the asterisk configuration and the instance that may be binded is unbinded, have that in mind when using it.

	This function determinates the angle the container's tail must rotate so its base stays withing the dialog bounding box itself, used by the set_tail_position() function.
	The formula used for this took 3 days to determinate alone, quite the heavy task, with that determianted the implementation was quick in less than 1 hour (not counting bug fixing hours due to the method and formula implementations XD, but less than a day, I swear).
	
	This formula has always one solution for a distance and angle set, but it cannot be calculated in a closed form (getting the solution by making the calculations with the formula just once).
	This uses an aproximation method, meaning the solution is not even 100% accurate, but is 99% accurate, good enough.
	Using newton raphson aproximation alone, the root is aproximated to determinate the correct angle the tail should be rotated to fit in place.
	With the angle gotten, everything lands smoothly, in case you ask by the way, no _angle is not the angle the tail should be rotated.
	For more information on this formula and method see the programmer documentation, maybe you can find a better way to do this, it doesn't take much to calculate surprisingly, no lag experienced during testing (unless you show text in the debug while inside the cycle, if you have a potato PC you maye experience a lag spike with that, for your safety avoid calling the set_tail_position() function every frame with debug text showing).
	
	REAL _d -----> Distance between the position the tail must be and the closest corner of the bounding box of the dialog itself, this may always be positive, giving a negative distance may result in infinite loops or incorrect angle results.
	REAL _angle -> Angle between the position the tail must be and the closest corner of the bounding box of the dialog itself.
	REAL _xn ----> Initial angle to iterate as the newthon raphson method needs it, depending on the corner, it could be 45 (for the corner top right as the tail can only be in angle 0°-90°), 135, 225 and 315, follow this set with the corresponding corner with its corresponding _angle, settings other initial angle values may result in infinite loops or incorrect angle results that not even newthon raphson with bisection variant can get right, reasons are unknown as it has not been studied yet.
